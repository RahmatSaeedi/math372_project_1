Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of

 allocating finite resources has been known for centuries.
 Certainly, as long as there have been functional economies (even systems
 as simple as barter networks), producers have been pressured to utilize
 labour, capital, and raw materials in the most efficient manner possible.
 More generally, there exist an entire class of problems known as Assignment
 Problems.

 This could mean assigning workers of various skill levels to machines in
 a factory, scheduling specific types of products to be produced on assembly
 lines of varying capacity, reducing change-over and re-tooling costs during
 production, and many other problems.
 In this paper, we examine the problem of assigning a varied workload of
 tasks to a group of employees of varying skill levels in such a way that
 we minimize the elapsed time, commonly referred to as the

Our problem is important because it directly affects the throughput and,
 therefore, the profitability of the office we study.
 By finding an optimal assignment strategy that minimizes the amount of
 time it takes to complete a task, we can be sure that the office operates
 in an efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable manner over the long term.

Historical Context
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While people have encountered Assignment Problems for at least several centuries
, we lacked the tools to effectively tackle them, especially in the general
 sense, until fairly recently.
 Indeed, neither the Renaissance nor the Industrial Revolution produced
 the necessary confluence of applied and theoretical mathematics and advanced
 computational technology required to enable business owners to solve these
 types of problems unassisted.
 By the mid-20
